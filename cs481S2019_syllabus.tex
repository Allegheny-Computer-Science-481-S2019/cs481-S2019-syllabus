\subsection*{Course Meeting Schedule}

Discussion and Practical Session: Thursday, 1:30 pm--2:20 pm \\

\noindent Students should plan to work outside of the course session on the
team-based projects and reports.

\subsection*{Course Description}

\begin{quote}

A continuation of CMPSC 480, with a focus on the collaborative enhancement of
innovative software. While partnering with members of the course and receiving
mentorship from experts in the software community, students document, improve,
and maintain a publicly available software tool. During a weekly practical
session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete and release a
significant software product, describing it through oral presentations and
written documents featured on a web site. Prerequisite: CMPSC 203 and CMPSC 480.
Distribution Requirements: None.

\end{quote}

\noindent Students can access the course's web site by visiting the instructor's
site, clicking the ``Courses'' link in the top left-hand corner, and looking for
the name and number of this course in the listing.

\subsection*{Course Objectives}

David J. Deming's recent report for the National Bureau of Economic Research
(NBER) points out that employment and wage growth is strongest for careers that
required the ``unusual combination'' of both technical and professional skills.
Moreover, computer science students who are looking for internships, their first
job, or a position in graduate school, must have a portfolio of technical work
that documents their ability to collaboratively develop useful software.

Students in CMPSC 481 will continue to learn how to effectively participate in
well-known online technical and professional communities such as GitHub and
StackOverflow. In addition to expanding their online professional presence,
students will learn how to build and leverage professional networks in a
technical field.
%


Students will also design, implement, and publicly release at
least one software tool.

Leveraging a mobile-ready website that they create for
this course, students will share written documents and oral presentations that
promote their innovative software.

\subsection*{Performance Objectives}

At the completion of this class, all students must have a mobile ready website
featuring their professional reflections and experiences. Students should be
comfortable finding needed information from, participating in, and contributing
to online technical communities. In this class students are also expected to
start building personal interactions with the industry experts. Students must
release at least one software tool that conforms to the industry standards,
conventions and best practices on styling, coding and ethics. Finally, students
should be comfortable with formal and informal knowledge sharing activities,
such as giving technical presentations and leading code reviews.

\subsection*{Course Policies}

\subsubsection*{Grading}

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, it is possible for the course instructor to change the assigned
percentages during the academic semester.

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Class Participation        & 10\%  \\
    Project Reports            & 40\% \\
    Software Projects          & 50\%
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
These grading categories have the following definitions:

\vspace*{-.05in}

\begin{itemize}

  \item {\em Class Participation\/}: All students are required to actively
    participate during all of the course sessions. Your participation will take
    forms such as answering questions about the reading assignments, asking
    constructive questions of group members, giving presentations, and leading a
    discussion. You also must regularly participate in the discussions in the
    course's Slack workspace. A student will receive an interim and final letter
    grade for this category.

  \item {\em Project Reports\/}: Graded on both a letter-grade and a
    credit/no-credit basis, these reports invite students to furnish evidence of
    their mastery of the technical and professional knowledge and skills in
    software engineering. Students will submit reports and receive feedback on
    ways in which they can improve their mastery of the aforementioned skills.
    At the completion of a project, students will submit a report documenting
    their overall knowledge and skills.

  \item {\em Software Projects\/}: Graded on a letter-grade basis, these
    team-based projects invite students to design, implement, test, document,
    deploy, and maintain a high-quality software system released under an
    open-source licence through a publicly available version control repository.
    In addition to encouraging students to enhance their technical knowledge and
    skills, these projects will invite you to refine your ability to work
    effectively with a team.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Assignment Submission and Evaluation}

All assignments will have a stated due date. Electronic versions of the
practical assignments and project reports must be submitted to a student's
GitHub repository; students will learn how to use version control with GitHub
during the first laboratory and practical sessions. Electronic versions of the
software projects must also be submitted through a designated public GitHub
repository. No credit will be awarded for any course work that is not submitted
to your GitHub repository with the required name.
%
Unless specified otherwise, all project reports must be turned in at the
beginning of the session that is one week after the day the assignment was
released. Practical assignments will be due at the start of the next class
session, unless otherwise stated. The two software projects will have deadlines
determined in consultation with the students in the course. Without making
special arrangements with the instructor, no work will be accepted after the
published deadline.
%
Using a report that the instructor shares with you through the commit log in
GitHub, you will privately received a grade for and feedback on each assignment.
Your grade will be a function of whether or you not completed correct work and
submitted it by the deadline. Other factors (e.g., the quality of your source
code, technical writing, and team work) will also influence your assignment's
grade.

\vspace*{-.1in}

\subsubsection*{Course Attendance}

It is mandatory for all students to attend all of the class, practical, and
laboratory sessions. If, due to extenuating circumstances, you will not be able
to attend a session, then, whenever possible, please see the course instructor
at least one week in advance to describe your situation. Students who miss more
than five unexcused sessions will have their final grade in the course reduced
by one letter grade. Students who miss more than ten of the aforementioned
events will fail the course.

\vspace*{-.05in}

\subsubsection*{Use of Laboratory Facilities}

Throughout the semester, we will employ many different software tools that
computer scientists use during the design, implementation, and evaluation of
computer software. Since it is unlikely that a student's unmodified computer
will have the software tools that correctly support the completion of the
course's assignments, unless there are documented extenuating circumstances,
students are advised to complete all of their work for this course while using
the laboratory facilities.

\subsubsection*{Seeking Assistance}

Students who are struggling to understand the knowledge and skills developed in
a class, laboratory, or practical session are encouraged to seek assistance from
the course instructor, the teaching assistants, or the departmental tutors.
Throughout the semester, students should, within the bounds of the Honor Code,
ask and answer questions on the Slack workspace for our course; please request
assistance from the instructor, teaching assistants, and tutors first through
Slack before sending an email. Students who need the course instructor's
assistance must schedule a meeting through \instructorpronoun{} web site and
come to the meeting with all of the details needed to discuss their question.

\subsubsection*{Using GitHub}

When completing the software projects, students must give evidence of their work
through GitHub's issue tracker and logs of pull requests and commits. Unless you
make prior arrangements with the instructor, only work submitted through GitHub
will count towards your grade for these projects.

\subsubsection*{Using Email}

Although we will primarily use Slack for non-GitHub communication, I will
sometimes use email to send announcements about important matters such as
schedule changes. It is your responsibility to check your email at least once a
day and to ensure that you can reliably send and receive emails. This class
policy is based on the statement about the use of email that appears in {\em The
Compass}, the College's student handbook; please see the instructor if you do
not have this handbook.

\subsubsection*{Honor Code}

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny
College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor Program
applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit
requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work
assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and the
final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under
the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has
acknowledged the following pledge:

\vspace*{-.10in}
%
\begin{quote}
%
  I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in
  the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College
  community as a whole.
%
\end{quote}
%
\vspace*{-.10in}

\noindent It is understood that an important part of the learning process in any
course, and particularly one in software engineering, derives from thoughtful
discussions with teachers and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged.
However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who
discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who
produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone
else's work. While it is acceptable for students in this class to discuss their
programs, documents, and reports with their classmates, deliverables that are
nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating
the \mbox{Honor Code}.

\subsubsection*{Disability Services}

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination
statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with
disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires all students with
disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable
accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they
may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability
Services at 332--2898. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons and
is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure
that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

\subsection*{Welcome to an Adventure in Software Innovation}

In reference to software, Frederick Brooks, Jr.\ wrote in Chapter One of MMM,
``The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.'' Software is a
pervasive aspect of our society that changes how we think and act. High quality
software also has the potential to positively influence the lives of people.
Moreover, the specification, design, implementation, testing, maintenance, and
documentation of software are exciting and rewarding activities! At the start of
this class, I invite you to pursue, with great enthusiasm and vigor, this
adventure in software engineering.
